# PWA Extra Bundle

This bundle is a playground for ideas to improve https://github.com/Spomky-Labs/phpwa

The idea is that after these tools are developed they'll be incorporated into that the core bundle and this one won't be necessary.  

## Extra Features

Before generating the initial configuration, generate the icons.  Yes, this is a bit of a pain, but it's a requirement for the manifest.  A manifest is required to run offline.



To generate the initial PWA Yaml configuration, run 

```bash
bin/console survos:pwa:config
```
